      <font size="+3">Hello,</font>
      <p>
        Dan here. I am a creative researcher and maker in the play
        field of art, science and technology. I often take and combine
        inspirations and insights from different disciplines to explore
        questions and phenomena that trigger my curiosity. Among other things, I
        am particularly interested in the poetics and aesthetics of
        interaction and communication through and with computational
        technologies, as well as how they shape and mediate our embodied and social
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working on my PhD in the field of interactive art at
        <a
          href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dan-xu#tab-1"
          target="_blank"
          >Leiden University</a
        > in the Netherlands. My research explores co-located
        interaction in interactive art: when more than one co-located audience
        interact with the art system at the same time and the interaction
        between them is integral to the artwork. I am interested in what forms
        can co-located interaction take and, more importantly, what makes it
        interactive.

        coaching. In this period, I have led and worked on digital
        transformation projects that questions
