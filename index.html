        Hello, my name is Dan Xu. I am a creative researcher and maker/coder in
        the playground of art, science and technology. Among many things, I am
        particularly interested in the poetics and creative possibilities of
        human (and non-human) computer interaction, as well as how such
        technologies shape and mediate our embodied and social realities. Coming
        from a multidisciplinary background, I like to take and combine insights
        and approaches from different disciplines to explore questions and
        phenomena that trigger my curiosity. Besides research, I often make
        stuff with sound, text and code.
      </p>

        Currently, I am mainly busy with my PhD research at Leiden University in
        the Netherlands. In this project, I am exploring different ways to think
        about and create interactions in the context of interactive art. One of
        the main outcomes of this research is a
        <a href="https://danxxxu.github.io/relational-model/" target="_blank"
          >web-based tool</a
        >
        for modelling, visualising and creating interactive dialogues. Using the
        tool as an analytical lens, I have peered into the fields of co-located
        audience interaction and more-than-human interactive art that involved
        both human and non-human participants. All my publications can be found

        Prior to the PhD, I worked as a Digital Transformation Designer at
        Digital Society School affiliated with Amsterdam University of Applied
        Sciences. In this period, I have led and worked on digital
        transformation projects that questions
