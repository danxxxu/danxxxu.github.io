      <p> My name is Dan Xu. I am a multidisciplinary researcher, artist, and creative technologist from China and currently based in the Netherlands. Among many things, I am particularly interested in the creative possibilities of emerging digital technologies for expression and communication, as well as how they shape and mediate our embodied and social realities. I like to take and combine insights and approaches from different disciplines to explore questions and phenomena that trigger my curiosity. Besides research, I often make thing with sound, text and code.</p>
      <p>Since 2020, I have been <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/dan-xu#tab-1" target="_blank">pursuing my doctoral degree at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science in Leiden University</a>. In my research, I have been focusing on developing a formal framework to understand and create interactions in interactive art. I have published and presented my research at various international conferences, including International Symposium of Electronic Art (ISEA) and the EAI ArtsIT conference, as well as the leading Art-Science-Technology Journal <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/leon_a_02660/127821/A-Relational-Look-at-Interactions-between-Humans?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">Leonardo</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2024, together with some friends, we were awarded the <a href="https://medium.com/@ProcessingOrg/meet-our-2024-processing-foundation-fellows-4b7f5ed5d104" target="_blank">Processing Foundation Fellowship</a> for our collective project <a href="https://www.screentosoundscape.com/" target="_blank">Screen-to-Soundscape</a>. In this project, we have been exploring how AI and spatial audio technologies could potentially transform the online experiences for blind and visually impaired individuals. </p>
      <p>From 2021 and 2022, I was one of the first artists in residence at the <a href="https://www.theaterutrecht.nl/voorstellingen/innovationlab-experiences-1" target="_blank">Innovation Lab of Theater Utrecht</a>. During this time, I collaborated closely with a multidisciplinary team consisting of artists and creative technologists. Together, we developed a sonic VR platform tailored for crafting immersive and interactive audio performances, and also created an immersive participatory performance designed for individual engagement showcasing this platform.</p>
      <p>From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a <a href="https://digitalsocietyschool.org/digital-to-physical/" target="_blank">Digital Transformation Designer at Digital Society School</a> affiliated with Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. In this period, I led and contributed to a wide array of digital transformation design research projects, under the overarching theme of <i>Digital to Physical</i>, in co-creation with multidisciplinary teams and various industry partners. These projects include: <a href="https://digitalsocietyschool.org/project/smarter-campus/" target="_blank">leveraging Internet of Things technologies to engage community members and foster meaningful connections</a>, <a href="https://digitalsocietyschool.org/project/inclusive-arena/" target="_blank">creating inclusive audience experiences for the visually impaired using audio-haptic technologies</a>, <a href="https://digitalsocietyschool.org/project/justice-in-the-digital-society/" target="_blank">exploring digital transformation opportunities for forensic mental healthcare practices</a>. Some research insights from these projects are published and presented at various international conferences, including ACM SIGCHI. In the meantime, I have been engaging in providing educational activities in the form of hands-on workshops for topics such as Design Thinking, Creative Coding and Fast Prototyping.  </p>
